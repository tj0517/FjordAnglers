# Implementation Plan - Landing Page Refactor

## Goal Description
Refactor the current homepage to a specific landing page for inviting fishing guides. The original homepage will be moved to a new route (e.g., `/explore`) to preserve it but keep it hidden from the main entry point. The new landing page will focus on the company's mission/vision and include a detailed form for guides to express interest and provide feedback.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current homepage at `/` will be replaced. The old content will be moved to `/explore`. Please confirm if `/explore` is the desired route name.

> [!NOTE]
> The new landing page will require new components: `MissionSection`, `VisionSection`, and `GuideForm`.

## Proposed Changes

### Routing & file structure
#### [NEW] [Explore Page]
- Create `src/app/explore/page.tsx`.
- Move content from [src/app/page.tsx](file:///Users/tymonjezionek/Desktop/fjordAnglers/web/src/app/page.tsx) to `src/app/explore/page.tsx`.

#### [MODIFY] [Root Page](file:///Users/tymonjezionek/Desktop/fjordAnglers/web/src/app/page.tsx)
- Replace content with new components:
    - `<Navbar />` (keep or modify?)
    - `<HeroSimple />` (New component for simple mission statement)
    - `<MissionVision />` (New component)
    - `<GuideForm />` (New form component)
    - `<Footer />`

### Components
#### [NEW] [GuideForm](file:///Users/tymonjezionek/Desktop/fjordAnglers/web/src/components/GuideForm.tsx)
- Fields:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Location/Region
    - Experience (Years)
    - "What are your biggest pain points?" (Textarea)
    - "What features would you like to see?" (Textarea)
- Submission logic (initially `console.log` or a mock server action).

#### [NEW] [MissionVision](file:///Users/tymonjezionek/Desktop/fjordAnglers/web/src/components/MissionVision.tsx)
- Text content explaining the platform's goal.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Verify `/` loads the new landing page with the form.
- Verify `/explore` loads the old homepage.
- Test form submission (check logs).
